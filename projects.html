                <h3>Thesis Abstract</h3>

                <p>
                  Containerization technology has become increasingly popular as corporations adopt cloud architecture solutions. Containers streamline the development, testing, and deployment of applications by bundling them with necessary components, including the operating system environment. However, security concerns remain the primary obstacle to widespread adoption. In multi-tenant environments, such as those offered by Container as a Service (CaaS) providers, the risk of container breakouts is a critical concern. This thesis focuses on identifying the technical features essential for selecting a container runtime software to mitigate the threat of container breakouts. These criteria are developed by gaining a sufficient background understanding of the Linux kernel technologies underlying containerization. We evaluate four popular runtimes - LXC, Apptainer, runC, and gVisor - by examining their static features, architecture, rootless operation capabilities, and publicly known vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that runC is the least suitable option due to its weak configurations, as well as a history of flaws and lax patching policy. Apptainer stands out for its use in high-performance computing (HPC) due to its immutability guarantees and design-centric integration of rootless containers. LXC presents a reliable choice due to its maturity, while gVisor is worth considering for those seeking the latest innovations. However, to effectively mitigate the threat of container breakouts, it is essential to investigate why they occur empirically – possibly due to leaked credentials or phishing rather than flaws in runtime software.

                <h3>Java Database Project</h3>
                <p>A literature database program for command-line based interaction, student project in summer semester 2023. The database is stored in the form of a XML file and is loaded into the program for modification and can be exported back to XML. It was required to never let exceptions reach the user, but keep a consistent and reasonable flow of interaction anyway. There also had to be two menus, a main menu and a submenu. The menus had to offer the following options:</p>

                <h3>Database Menu/ Submenu:</h3>
                <ul>

                  <li>Back to main menu / close without saving</li>

                <p>The sub-tasks we had to implement were these:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>make the correct XML annotations for marshalling/ unmarshalling the file with JAXB</li>
