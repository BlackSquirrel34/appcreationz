          <p>Are you interested in becoming a full-stack web developer? In this blog post, we'll explore how to set up a modern web application using React for the front end, Vite for a fast development experience, and Node.js for your backend. This powerful combination allows you to build dynamic, responsive applications with ease. With React’s component-based architecture, you can interactive user interfaces, while Vite ensures quick startup and hot module replacement, optimizing your development process. On the backend, Node.js can handle server-side logic and database interactions efficiently.
          By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a simple yet fully functional full-stack application. Let’s get started!
          </p>
          <p>
            In this tutorial, we will:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Setup a Front end using React and Vite</li>
                <li>Setup a Backend with Node</li>

                <p>You can create a simple web server in Node using its built-in node:http module. Write these lines of code into your index.js:</p>

                <div class="intext-img-dark"> <pre><code class="language-javascript">
                  // Basic Web Server Example
                  const { createServer } = require('node:http');

                  const server = createServer((req, res) => {
                    res.statusCode = 200;
                    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
                    res.end('Hello World');
                  });

                  server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
                    console.log('Server is running...');
                  });
                </code></pre>
              </div>

               

                <p>
                  This is Node.js's version of the classic "Hello World" example, and the best part is you don’t need to install anything to run this script; it utilizes Node's built-in capabilities.The code includes some key concepts worth noting
                </p> 
                <p>
                  First, we use the require statement to include a specific Node module. The require function, which appears at the beginning, helps manage module dependencies. It allows one module, like server.js, to access and use the functionality of another module, such as node:http. In this example, the built-in node:http module is essential for creating a web server. While there are many libraries available for building web servers, this one comes pre-installed with Node.js, so there’s no additional setup needed - just remember to require it.

                <p>
                  Next, we set up a new server that responds with a status code of 200 and sends the message "Helloworld" whenever a client accesses the site. We create a server object using the createServer function from the node:http module, which provides various functions to help us build web servers. This function requires a parameter called the Request Listener. The createServer function is responsible merely for creating the server object; it does not actually start the server. To activate the web server, you must call the listen method on the server that you've created.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We then instruct the server to listen on localhost at port 3000. In Node.js, a listener function is linked to a specific event and executes whenever that event occurs. In this case, Node will run the request listener function each time there’s an incoming connection to the web server. That’s the event triggering our listener function. Let's dig a little bit deeper:
                </p>

                 <div class="intext-img">
                  <img src="../assets/gearwheels.webp" alt="Contact Page screenshot 2">
                </div><br>

                <p>
                  The listener function takes two parameters:<br>
                    1. The request object, referred to as req in this example. This object allows you to access details about the incoming request, such as the requested URL and the IP address of the client making the request.<br>
                    2. The response object, named res in this example. This object enables you to send responses back to the requester. In this simple web server setup, it sets the response status code to 200 to signify a successful response, and it writes back the "Hello World" text with the Content-Type header set to text/plain using the end method of the res object.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The listen method accepts several parameters, including the operating system port and host to be used for the server. The final argument is a callback function that will be triggered once the server is successfully running on the designated port. (We'll explain what exactly a callback  function is in a dedicated blog post.) In the example above, this function simply logs a message to confirm that the server is operating correctly.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Node will run a web server, and you’ll notice that the Node process does not exit in this example. It has work to do in the background. It waits for users to request data and serve them a plain “Hello World” text when they do.
                  While the server is running, go to a browser and ask for an http connection on localhost with the port that was used in the script (3000 in this case). You will see the Hello World text that this example had in its request listener function. To stop the web server, press CTRL+C in the terminal where it’s running.<br>

                  Congratulations, you just created your first web server with node.
